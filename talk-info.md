Practical Guide to Docker

  Docker is everywhere but nobody knows what to do with it.  
  The goal of this session is to provide you with everything you need to start using it.

  We'll discuss and demonstrate the following:
  
  * What exactly is Docker?
  * What problems is docker solving?
  * How to use it for the development work flow?
  * How to use it for deployment/production work flow?


  We'll try to do that without a lot of boring concepts. Instead we are going to look at a real-world Node.js application that uses multiple Docker containers.
